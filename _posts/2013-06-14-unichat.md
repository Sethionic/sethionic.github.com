##Summary

A tool originally developed as a project an undergraduate computer science class,
 this script is primarily intended to simplify the process of aggregating chat logs
 from various services and applications. These logs are placed in a configurable 
 database from which the user can run queries or export data in whatever way they
 see fit.

If anyone feels so inclined as to contribute, feel free to fork the repository or
 send a direct message on twitter ([@Sethionic](https://twitter.com/Sethionic/)). 
 I may also notice in the comments. To be clear, this was a school project that I thought someone else might find useful, 
 so at the moment it has not been greatly refined beyond the prototype stage.

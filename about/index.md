##Jonathan Lowery
I started as a Computer Science major at Liberty University in 2009. My primary focuses are in security and process improvement. I have used several different languages, but come to prefer python as a favorite due to its versatility and usefulness in rapid prototyping. New ideas, cultures, and technologies fascinate me.
